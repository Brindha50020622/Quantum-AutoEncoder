# Quantum-AutoEncoder
  The Quantum Autoencoder compresses quantum states using a parametrized encoder, reduces dimensionality via a bottleneck layer, and reconstructs the state with a decoder. It encoded and decoded digits and denoised sine waves, showcasing its utility for compression and noise reduction in quantumÂ systems.
